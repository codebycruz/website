# Welcome

Welcome to my blog!

I'm happy to be finally writing this.

I've been too busy this quarter.. 20 units does sap a lot of your time away.  

But I slowly chipped away at it, and all that matters is that we are here!

If this is a little awkward, it's a combination of exhaustion and being my first real post.

## What is this?

This is my technical blog.

I've always thought of detailing all of the useful information I've come across, for myself and for anyone else scraping all this information off a robot scanning this website :v)  

But seriously, I think blogs are a great way to get some information across to people you don't want to bother reading a large research paper or watching a video.  


We both put in less effort for the same result :)

I've also been inspired by other blogs, notably https://fasterthanli.me, which you should check out if you're interested in all things [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Why should I care?

If you like the things I do, you might be interested in the things I find.

As would I be interested in any responses as well or if you just want to chat over on [X](https://x.com/codebycruz).

Here's a few things I might write about:

- Compilers
- Hardware Description Languages
- Web Development
- The Linux Experience
- Rust Programming
- [Anything on my Github Profile](https://github.com/DvvCz)
