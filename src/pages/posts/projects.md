They're back and much cleaner.

![changes](/posts/projects-changes.avif)

Look at all those changes..

## Tags

I enjoyed working on the tag system. They get custom styling and icons for specific tooling I thought were significant.

[![tags](/posts/tags.avif)](/projects)

Pretty snazzy.

## New Projects

It's been a while since the astro rewrite. I made a bunch of new projects and I newly documented some missing ones now.

There are a total of 7 projects at the moment.

## They get their own pages

Biggest thing is now they support having their own pages.

Pending time and inspiration for each project, I'll write custom pages going more in-depth about the research and work that went into the project.

They link to their respective open sourced github repos, minus the 2 stealth/wip projects I have which are not published.
