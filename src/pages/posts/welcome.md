Welcome to my blog!

I'm happy to be finally writing this.

I've been too busy this quarter.. 20 units does sap a lot of your time away.

All that matters is that we're here now.

## What is this?

This is my technical blog.

I've always thought of detailing all of the useful information I've come across, for myself and for anyone else scraping all this information off a robot scanning this website 😉

But seriously, I think blogs are a great way to get some information across to people you don't want to bother reading a large research paper or watching a video.

We both put in less effort for the same result :)

I've also been inspired by other blogs, notably https://fasterthanli.me, which you should check out if you're interested in all things [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

## Why should I care?

If you like the things I do, you might be interested in the things I find.  
Here's a few things I might write about:

- Compilers
- Hardware Description Languages
- Web Development
- The Linux Experience
- Rust Programming
- [Anything on my Github Profile](https://github.com/codebycruz)

In some way or for some extended period of time I've had a lot of experience with everything above.

## Fin

That's about it. Keeping this one short, because

- I don't want to take up more of your time
- I don't have much time, either
